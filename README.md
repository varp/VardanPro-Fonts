# VardanPro Fonts
Custom compiled fonts based on Iosevka font. 

Fonts compiled with three character's styles:

1. Standard Iosevka - **Iosevka VardanPro**
2. Monaco Style - **Iosevka VardanPro Monaco Style**
3. Lucida Style - **Iosevka VardanPro Lucida Style**

All fonts compiled with full set of weights and slopes and customs enabled by default:

- "ligset-php" -  default ligatures set to PHP
- "v-asterisk-low" - asterisk verticaly centred in row
- "v-ampersand-upper-open" - ampersand upper opened version of &
- "v-dollar-open" - open version of $
- "cv67" - lower bar slanted version of <= and >= 

There are also `Light` version of fonts with weight set to 300 by default:

1. **Iosevka VardanPro Light**
2. **Iosevka VardanPro Monaco Light**
3. **Iosevka VardanPro Lucida Light**

They are very usefull to being installed as separate fonts in caeses when of IDE
like JetBrains' ones where editor does not allow to choose weight of font.
